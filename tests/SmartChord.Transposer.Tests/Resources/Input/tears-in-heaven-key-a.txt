Tears in Heaven – Eric Clapton

A   E/G#  F#m   D  E7sus E7  A


[Chorus]

A            E       F#m
Would you know my name,
D    A            E
If I saw you in heaven,
A        E      F#m
Would it be the same,
D    A            E
If I saw you in heaven,


[Verse]

F#m          C#
I must be strong,
Em        F#
and carry on,
           Bm               E7
Cause I know I don't belong,
           A
Here in heaven. 

A   E/G#  F#m   D  E7sus E7  A
