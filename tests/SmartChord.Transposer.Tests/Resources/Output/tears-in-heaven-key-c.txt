Tears in Heaven – Eric Clapton

C   G/B  Am   F  G7sus G7  C


[Chorus]

C            G       Am
Would you know my name,
F    C            G
If I saw you in heaven,
C        G      Am
Would it be the same,
F    C            G
If I saw you in heaven,


[Verse]

Am          E
I must be strong,
Gm        A
and carry on,
           Dm               G7
Cause I know I don't belong,
           C
Here in heaven. 

C   G/B  Am   F  G7sus G7  C
